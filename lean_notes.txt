If you're working with components of pairs, deconstruct the pairs as soon as possible.
  obtain ⟨w,z⟩ := pt

To finish off inequalities:
  norm_num  -- ( turns 0.5 and 2⁻¹ into 1/2 ; without this, bound doesn't work; may needs to be used at hypotheses too)
  bound


To rewrite something involving a bound variable, use simp instead of rw


use @irreducible on very large data to avoid stack overflows with every type error
